%% CPNN dynamic texture descriptor
% this code computes a feature vector using the CPNN descriptor
% input:
%   -video: a 3D matrix with HxWxN pixels
%   -QS: set of number of hidden neurons (default: QS = [4,24,29])
%   -R: set of maximum radius for modeling (default: R = [4,10];
% output:
%   -ff: feature vector
